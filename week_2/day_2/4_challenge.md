# Day 2

## Challenge

- Now that I've shown you how to build tie up the users with your other models. It's time for you to complete the remaining methods.

- Add the `before_action` filter on methods you think should require a user to log in first before being able to do it.

- Create the views for your user, allow them to register, edit, and log out.

- Modify some of the actions to use associations to create new records in your database, one example has been provided to you, the topics controller `create` action.
